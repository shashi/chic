<h3>Joybubbles and the founding of Phreaking</h3>
<img src="images/phreaks.jpg" alt="">
Joe Engressia was blind, but he had been compensated by the fascinating gift of perfect pitch. He could recall a note he had heard, and perfectly reproduce it by whistling. At age eight, he had already discovered that he could manipulate the system of telephone switches by whistling certain tones. These systems were called multi-frequency systems (MF), and it was information about these systems that Bell made the mistake of publishing in 1960. The slang term for these tones and their use was &#8220;Marty Freeman.&#8221; Joe was arrested after connecting free calls for some friends by simply whistling into the receiver. Thanks to the publicity surrounding the incident, Joe and other telephone enthusiasts formed a rapidly growing underground network mainly consisting of blind people. A few knew how to whistle the tones, while others employed early keyboards and synthesizers to produce the necessary sounds. Through Joe, phreaking grew into a major youth movement. He was arrested again in 1971, and was given a suspended sentence in exchange for promising never to manipulate telephones again. Later, he was hired by a small Tennessee company as a telephone repairman.</div></div>

    &#34;It _is_ a long tail, certainly,&#34; said Alice, looking

There is often confusion about the precise set of newsgroups that constitute Usenet; one commonly accepted definition is that it consists of newsgroups listed in the periodic &#8220;List of Active Newsgroups&#8221; postings which appear regularly in news.lists and other newsgroups.  (Note that the correct term is &#8220;newsgroups&#8221;; they are not called areas, bases, boards, bboards, conferences, round tables, SIGs, echoes, rooms or usergroups!  Nor, as noted above, are they part of the Internet, though they may reach your site over it.  Furthermore, the people who run the news systems are called news administrators, not sysops.  If you want to be understood, be accurate.)</p>
